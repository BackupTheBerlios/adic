adic (0.9.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * improved camera scroll 
    (take speed into account when setting wished camera position)
  * auto rotation can now be seperately enabled/disabled (Key: "3")
  * camera setting on level start respects users settings 
    of auto-rotation/zoom/scroll
  * fixed bug: scrolling was "wrong" if rotated
  * all player data is now relative to default.xml
    (relative means multiplied with the default)
  * adjusted parameters (faster, faster acceleration)
  * maxfitness wasn't used - now it is.
    This means you can run for some time without loosing speed 
    if you embrassed a team mate or drunk from a fountain. 
    (the fountain gives you a 20% speed boost for some time)
